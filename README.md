This is a hackathon competition held by Pactrans Region 10 Virtual Conference.

In late March, the SMB (Small and Medium Business) Group surveyed more than 500 businesses and found that personal service and retail are two categories most affected by covid-19. By means of this hackathon, we proposed solutions for local businesses to counter the impact.

We visualized the changes in TPS of all segments. We make TPS in February as the baseline condition since it is before the coronavirus pandemic and computed the delta TPS from March to the end of June.

We can see that Industrial areas do not change a lot since they still require human operations. However, there are two areas that change the most in TPS, which are Northgate to downtown Seattle and Newcastle to Bellevue. We can see that the traffic travelling from urban residential to intensive urban has decreased a lot. It may be due to the WFH policy. People no longer have to travel to work and companies started to stop renting offices. A boba tea shopkeeper told me that the turnover has decreased more than two third of the original value, and so do the restaurants nearby the University of Washington. While the traffic volume from Northgate to downtown Seattle and from Newcastle to Bellevue have decreased, it nay indicate that people are staying in Northgate and Newcastle more often. This can be a hint for local businesses to decide where to put advertisements or where to open a new store.
